Description: Constructs robust quality control chart based on the median or Hodges-Lehmann estimator (location) and the median absolute deviation (MAD) or Shamos estimator (scale). These estimators are all unbiased with a sample of finite size. For more details, see Park, Kim and Wang (2020) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2019.1699114>. In addition, using this package, the conventional quality control charts such as Xbar, S and R charts are also easily constructed.
