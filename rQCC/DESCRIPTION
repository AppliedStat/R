Description: Constructs various robust quality control charts based on the median or Hodges-Lehmann estimator (location) and the median absolute deviation (MAD) or Shamos estimator (scale). The estimators used for the robust control charts are all unbiased with a sample of finite size. For more details, see Park, Kim and Wang (2022) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2019.1699114>. In addition, using this R package, the conventional quality control charts such as X-bar, S, R, p, np, u, c, g and h charts are also easily constructed.
