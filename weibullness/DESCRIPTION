Description: Performs a goodness-of-fit test of Weibull distribution (weibullness test) and provides the maximum likelihood estimates of the three-parameter Weibull distribution. Note that the threshold parameter is estimated based on the correlation from the Weibull plot. For more details, see Park (2018) <doi:10.1155/2018/6056975>.
