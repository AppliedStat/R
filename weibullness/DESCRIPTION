Description: Conducts a goodness-of-fit test for the Weibull distribution (referred to as the weibullness test) and furnishes parameter estimations for both the two-parameter and three-parameter Weibull distributions. Notably, the threshold parameter is derived through correlation from the Weibull plot. Additionally, this package conducts goodness-of-fit assessments for the exponential, Gumbel, and inverse Weibull distributions, accompanied by parameter estimations.
